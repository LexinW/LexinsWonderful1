# week1project

I first cleaned up all the code in the html and css to be in order, so its easier to find the area of code you are working with.

I changed all /div to semantic html elements like aside, section, main, article, and nav. I also changed the css to match the new elements.

I then added alt attributes to all image files to read "palce holder image"

Lastly, I added a concise, descriptive title to the title section of the website!

I beleive thats all the changes to the code I made. I also added in comments to the css file to describe all the changes or sections in the code.
